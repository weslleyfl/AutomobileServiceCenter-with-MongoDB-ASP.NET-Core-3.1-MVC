The content of Navigation.json will hold all the menu items and the associated information. Each navigation menu item has the following properties:

• DisplayName: Text that needs to be displayed on the user interface.
• MaterialIcon: Icon from Material Design that needs to be displayed along with the
display name.
• Link: URL to which the menu item should be redirected.
• IsNested: This property indicates whether the current menu item has child menu
items. In the processing logic that we are going to come up with, if any menu item
has child menu items, then the URL link of the parent will be ignored.
• Sequence: The display sequence of the menu items in the entire menu.
• UserRoles: User roles that are allowed to view the current menu item.
• NestedItems: If IsNested is True, the child navigation menu items will be stored in this array. Each child navigation item will share the same structure as any top-level menu item.
